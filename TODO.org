* TR069 prototype requirement
  The assumption is we will have Netconf confd and most likely SNMP confd.

** Here is what I would expect:
   1. Install TR069 stack [0/3]
      - [ ] For now open source is fine..
      - [ ] Later we will have to think commercial
      - [ ] and implication

   2. TR069 protocol and interface with HDM. [0/5]
      - [ ] SetParameterValues
      - [ ] GetParameterValues
      - [ ] Download
      - [ ] Periodic Inform
      - [ ] Inform

   3. Validate registration (TR-106 oarameters etc)

   4. Validate alarms raised (OAM-C) can be mapped to TR069 informs.

   5. Validate a set parameter via TR069 can be written to confd.

   6. Validate a get parameter request can read something from confD.

 
** In second round we can try:
   1. sftp of bulk CM based on URL sent by HDM. [0/1]
      - [ ] TransferComplete
   2. Alarm sync, data sync
 
   Does this align with your views?
 


* Prepare build and testing environment

** Erlang/OTP test server
   This is what OTP uses, and they have several thousand test cases
   written for OTP. It's used by several large commercial projects. It
   has support for multi-target testing, and automated testing of
   embedded systems.

** eUnit
   This is for simpler unit testing, and can surely be combined with
   the Test Server.
