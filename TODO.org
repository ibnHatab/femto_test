** Erlang/OTP test server
   This is what OTP uses, and they have several thousand test cases
   written for OTP. It's used by several large commercial projects. It
   has support for multi-target testing, and automated testing of
   embedded systems.

** eUnit
   This is for simpler unit testing, and can surely be combined with
   the Test Server.

** Erlang QuickCheck (ErProp)
