<h1>PULSE ProTest User Level Scheduler for Erlang </h1>
<p>Copyright © Quviq AB, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012.  </p>
<p>PULSE is a randomizing scheduler for Erlang, which can
be used to find race conditions in concurrent Erlang code. It was
initially developed at Chalmers University under the ProTest project
(www.protest-project.eu) by the ProTest research group, consisting of
Thomas Arts, Koen Claessen, John Hughes, Michal Palka, Nick Smallbone
and Hans Svensson--see our paper at ICFP 2009--and released under a
BSD licence. This version has been extended and integrated into QuickCheck by
Quviq.</p>

<h2>Concurrency errors</h2>

<p>
PULSE is used to increase the possibility to find concurrency errors as well
as to improve the analysis of these errors by offering the ability to create 
random schedulings and rerun the same scheduling deterministically.
</p>

<p>
In order to use PULSE, one needs to instrument the code under test by compiling it 
with a special flag (see <a href="pulse_instrument.html"><code>pulse_instrument</code></a>). After that, the concurrent processes 
are run by calling <a href="pulse.html#run-1"><code>pulse:run/1</code></a>. Note that one may need to start the application
pulse first (which will start QuickCheck).
</p>

As an example, consider the following "hello world" function:
<pre>
helloworld() -&gt;
  Self = self(),
  ForwardPid = 
	  spawn(fun() -&gt;
		        receive Msg -&gt; Self ! Msg end
	        end),
  spawn(fun() -&gt; Self ! hello, ForwardPid ! world end),	
  receive
	   M1 -&gt; 
	      receive
		      M2 -&gt; [M1,M2]
	      end
  end.
</pre><p>
This program sends two messages to a receiving process, which returns the messages in
the way they arrived. Note that on a one core computer, the result is very predictable and 
always the same. However, when you port this program to a multi-core machine, you may
now and then see a different execution behaviour. For larger programs, this gets more evident.
In fact, when you would run each of the processes in a separate Erlang node, one would indeed 
see more often different orders of the two incoming messages.</p>

The Erlang scheduler, however, is too deterministic to find more than one order in which
the messages arrive and hence simple unit tests like
<pre>
[hello,world] = helloworld().
</pre><p>
would pass and let the developer believe the program has this behaviour.</p>

<p>
When the "hello world" program is compiled with PULSE, then it can be evaluated by using
more random schedules.
<pre>
1&gt; pulse:start().
ok
2&gt; pulse:verbose([all]).
[]
3&gt; pulse:run(fun() -&gt; examples:helloworld() end).
PULSE scheduling started
root spawns 'helloworld.ForwardPid' &lt;0.1360.0&gt; at {"examples.erl",47}
root spawns helloworld &lt;0.1361.0&gt; at {"examples.erl",52}
root blocks at {"examples.erl",56}
helloworld sends hello to root at {"examples.erl",53}
helloworld sends world to 'helloworld.ForwardPid' at {"examples.erl",54}
helloworld terminated normal
'helloworld.ForwardPid' blocks at {"examples.erl",48}
helloworld delivers world to 'helloworld.ForwardPid'
'helloworld.ForwardPid' receives world at {"examples.erl",49}
'helloworld.ForwardPid' sends world to root at {"examples.erl",49}
'helloworld.ForwardPid' terminated normal
'helloworld.ForwardPid' delivers world to root
root receives world at {"examples.erl",57}
root blocks at {"examples.erl",58}
helloworld delivers hello to root
root receives hello at {"examples.erl",59}
return value [world,hello]
PULSE scheduling finished
[world,hello]
</pre>
The output is in textual form and its verbosity can be adjusted via <a href="pulse.html#verbose-1"><code>pulse:verbose/1</code></a>. Visualization as a graph
is supported if graphviz is installed by using the event handler. PULSE does send by default all 
events to an event handler (pulse_event_terminal). By adding an extra event handler, one can send teh same events also
to the pulse_event_graph event handler, making it into a graph. 
</p>
<pre>
4&gt; gen_event:which_handlers(pulse_event).
[pulse_event_terminal]
5&gt; gen_event:add_handler(pulse_event,pulse_event_graph,[]).
ok
6&gt; pulse:rerun().
</pre>

<p>
When used with QuickCheck, the macro <tt>?PULSE</tt> is recommended. This macro has the same shape
as the <tt>?FORALL</tt> macro, i.e., <tt>?PULSE(Result,Generator,Property)</tt> where the 
generator is a function that is evaluated with a certain schedule, <tt>Result</tt> is the
result of the function and this can be used in the property. 
</p>

<pre>
prop_helloworld() -&gt;
    ?PULSE(Result,helloworld(), 
           Result == [hello,world]).
</pre>
